# Trust-in-AI
This is the research study settings using Lab.js. In this research, I designed a 2x2 mixed-subject experiment to investigate how the presence of ChatGPT label (between-subject factor: with vs. without) and the provision of explanations (within-subject factor: with vs. without) affect trust in AI over time. Participants engage in a complex decision-making task where they estimate jail time for 16 criminal law cases with AI advice. 

## Measurements
Both behavioral and self-reported trust are measured. Here I used Weight on Advice (WoA) as a measurement for behavioral trust. Weight on Advice = (2nd Estmate - 1st Estimate)/(AI Advice - 1st Estimate).

## Tool
I used lab.js as the platform to design my experiment. It's a simple, graphical tool to help you build studies for the web and the laboratory. Several javascript scripts should be added to customize the settings.
